# Password Strength Checker Dashboard

## Objective
This ongoing project is inspired by *'Password Strength Checker in Python'* by The Code City. The goal is to enhance security awareness by analyzing password trends and providing actionable recommendations on password security practices. Through iterative development, the project aims to create a tool that evaluates password strength and visualizes data insights to promote better password hygiene.  

### Skills Developing
- Proficiency in Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization.  
- Understanding of password strength metrics and their role in cybersecurity.  
- Ability to collect, preprocess, and analyze datasets related to password usage.  
- Experience in creating actionable recommendations based on data trends.  
- Enhanced problem-solving skills by addressing common password vulnerabilities.  

### Tools Being Used
- Pandas: For handling and preprocessing datasets.  
- Matplotlib: For creating visual representations of password trends.  
- Seaborn: For advanced data visualizations to identify patterns.  
- Jupyter Notebook: For iterative development and visualization. 

## Progress

## 1. Project Setup  
- Installed necessary Python libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Designed an initial password strength checker using regular expressions to evaluate factors like length, character variety, and inclusion of symbols.

### 2. Dataset Collection and Preliminary Analysis  
- Collecting a dataset of sample passwords (e.g., from open-source password lists) for analysis.  
- Preprocessing the data to categorize passwords by strength (weak, moderate, strong).  

### 3. Visualizations  
- Currently developing visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze trends, such as:  
  - Password length vs. strength.  
  - Common patterns in weak passwords.  
  - Distribution of special characters.  

### 4. Actionable Recommendations  
- Working on generating insights from preliminary data and drafting guidelines for creating strong passwords.

## Next Steps  
- Expand the dataset with more diverse password samples for broader analysis.  
- Refine visualizations and insights for clarity and impact.  
- Explore advanced methods like machine learning to improve password strength evaluation.  
- Develop a user-friendly interface to make the tool accessible to non-technical users.

## Conclusion  
As this project progresses, it is providing valuable insights into password security and helping develop skills in data analysis, visualization, and cybersecurity practices. Once complete, the Password Strength Checker will serve as a practical tool for promoting stronger password habits.
